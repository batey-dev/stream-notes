# `12-10-2024` Batey Stream #1

## Today's Agenda

* Advent of Code Speedrun (first 10 days)
* Setting some ground rules, goals, expectations for this stream (see [ABOUT.md](../ABOUT.md))


## Notes


* Got stuck on Day 2, Part 2 for too long because I wanted an elegant solution right away, rather than accept a general brute force solution.
* We need more/better music for the stream.
* We need a better distinction between presenter-mode and "just coding"-mode.


## Lessons (Re-)Learned

* Remember the [KISS Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
